## H2 Developer Profile Generator

This is a command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username. The application is invoked with the following command:

```sh
node index.js
```

The user will be prompted for a GitHub username, and a favorite colour, which will be used as the background colour for cards.

The PDF includes the profile picture, name, location, bio, number of repositories, number of followers, number of people following, and number of github stars of the entered GitHub username. 
The PDF is stored in the same folder as index.js
An image of the PDF is here: https://github.com/JEQP/DevProfGen/blob/master/JEQP.pdf
